Sleep Tracker - Kotlin
============================================================================

Solution code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelab 6.3 Recording Quality & Button States

Introduction
------------

TrackMySleepQuality is an app for recording sleep data for each night. 
You can record a start and stop time, assign a quality rating, and clear the database. 

In this codelab, working from this starter app, you:

* Extended the TrackMySleepQuality app to collect a quality rating, add it to the database and display the result.
* Used LiveData to trigger showing of a snackbar. 
* Use LiveData to enable and disable buttons.


Pre-requisites
--------------

You should be familiar with:

* Navigating between fragments, and using safeArgs to pass data between fragments.
* View models, view model factories, Transformations, and LiveData and their observers 
  from the preceding Architecture Components codelab[LINK].
* How to create a Room database, create a DAO, and define entities.
* How to use coroutines for database interactions and other long-running tasks.
